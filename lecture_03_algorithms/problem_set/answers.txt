sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: 'sort1' is the slowest sorting algorithm in the worst-case scenario among all three sorting algorithms. However, it is one of the fastest algorithms in the best-case scenario.
random 50k: 6.215s
reversed 50k: 5.673s
sorted 50k: 1.326s

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Among the three sorting algorithms, 'sort2' is the fastest and maintains consistency in all scenarios.
random 50k: 1.062s
reversed 50k: 1.123s
sorted 50k: 1.187s

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: 'sort3' performs faster than 'sort1' in the worst-case scenario, but it is still slower than 'sort2'.
random 50k: 3.010s
reversed 50k: 3.030s
sorted 50k: 3.054s
